# Call for Papers Repository

Welcome to the Call for Papers Repository! This repository serves as a central hub for submitting proposals for talks, presentations, or papers. Our preferred method of submission is through pull requests (PRs) to streamline the process. You are also welcome to open an issue for discussion before submitting a PR.

## How to Contribute

1. **Submit Proposal**: To submit a proposal, create a PR with the necessary details. Please follow the suggested template provided below when creating your PR. Engage in discussions and address any feedback received during the review process.

2. **Proposal Review**: The proposal will be reviewed by the repository maintainers. Engage in discussions and address any feedback or suggestions provided. This collaborative process allows for a thorough evaluation of each proposal.

3. **Proposal Approval**: Once your proposal has been reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the repository. Merging the PR signifies the acceptance of your proposal. Congratulations!

4. **Update Talk Information**: As the talk date approaches or after it has taken place, create another PR to update the talk's information. This PR will include the finalized date, location, any additional details, and a link to the talk's video or slides.

## Suggested PR Template

When creating your PR, we recommend using the following template to ensure that all the necessary information is included:

```

Date: Proposed or Finalized Date

Summary of your talk.

Any additional details such as preliminary requirements for the audience.

## Automation and Deployment

We are currently working on automating the process of collecting talk information to create a dedicated webpage. This webpage will showcase the accepted talks and provide easy access to the associated videos or slides. Stay tuned for further updates on this exciting development.
