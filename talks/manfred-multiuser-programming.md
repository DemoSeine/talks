In this talk, we will delve into the concept of multi-user programming languages and how they are set to revolutionize the open-source software paradigm.
We'll explore how these languages enable large-scale, interactive apps and introduce a new way of interacting with data that merges the convenience of old-school FTP with modern efficiency.

Audience members should have a basic understanding of open-source software and app development.
No specific technical skills are required, but a general familiarity with these areas will enhance the experience.

This talk is based on a mysterious project that I've been working on, which aims to push the boundaries of open-source software.
